<h1>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Spirit</h2>
<p>This is my favourite cartoon. The blending of animation types is unique, the storyline is amazing, and the music is wonderful.</p>
<h2>The Creator</h2>
<p>A movie that makes you think about existence and the world around you, explodes your brain with cool visuals and
sufficiently blows stuff up</p>
<h2>Doctor Stone</h2>
<p>Super interesting anime. Dr. Stone is one of those sorts of anime which you love even though it's extremely over the top. It's realistic while being
unrealistic, funny yet with high stakes.</p>
